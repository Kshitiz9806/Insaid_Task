This is the task for Insaid

I have created an implementation for the intial section of the homepage and the backend.

Install all the requirements using "npm install" for both the frontend and backend else you might not be able to run as i have deleted all the node_modules

Go to the specific Directory and run "npm start" to start the backend then start the frontend using the same command in the frontend directory.
